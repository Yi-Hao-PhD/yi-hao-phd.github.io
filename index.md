Learning and development (L&D) in adulthood drives my work, whether mentoring students and scholars or supporting colleagues and professionals. As a mixed-method researcher, I have always been fascinated by the interplay of individual identities and organizational structures. In my past research, I studied adult learning theories in the context of professional experience, leadership development, and career outcomes.

I have a proven record of developing high-impact initiatives and exercising leadership skills built upon authenticity, equity, and creativity. I have experience managing university-wide programs for large audiences, developing relationships with stakeholders, and using data and evaluation to drive engagement and innovation. 

My experiences navigating the U.S. higher education system as an immigrant, an Asian woman, and a social scientist fuel my commitment to diversity and inclusion. I continue to use my expertise to help others understand the intricacies of people and systems.
