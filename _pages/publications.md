I actively engage in various forms of thought leadership through scholarship and presentations. I have published 6 peer-reviewed journal articles and written for general audiences through Inside Higher Ed and HigherEdJobs. 
Currently, I have two accepted book chapters discussing the future directions of PhD education and change through career development in higher education.
